Every once in awhile, I'll be so excited about something that I'll want to share it with you, too. This might be a new project, something I've come across, or (rarely) a new post. I expect to send a letter roughly once a month or less; I certainly won't be crowding up your inbox.

If this is something you're interested in, sign up using the form below. If an email newsletter isn't your style, you can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/milesmccain/) or subscribe via [RSS](/index.xml).

        target="popupwindow"
        onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/milesmccain', 'popupwindow')"
        class="embeddable-buttondown-form"

    <label for="bd-email" class="label">Enter your email</label>
    <input type="email" name="email" id="bd-email" class="input ~neutral !low bg-neutral-000 mt-2 mb-3 shadow-none max-w-sm block" placeholder="Your email...">
