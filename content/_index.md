I am an undergraduate at CMU School of Computer Science with interests lying at the intersection of systems and machine learning.

I'm interested in problems that arise when we attempt to scale machine learning or to explore the very nature of ML. These include but are not limited to recommender systems, next-gen ML framework, MLOps systems, federated learning, and ML interpretability. 

### Currently

I am working with [Rashmi K. Vinayak](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rvinayak/) and [Jack Kosaian](https://jackkosaian.github.io/) in [TheSys research group](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rvinayak/#group) as part of the [Parallel Data Lab](https://www.pdl.cmu.edu/index.shtml) on fault tolerance and load balancing problems in industrial recommender systems. Some of this is inspired by my previous work at ByteDance, where I contributed to the large-scale graph embedding models and infrastructure in Douyin and TikTok.

I'm incubating an open-source project [Alpaca-Hub](https://alpaca-hub.github.io/) (which could potentially turn into a startup later) as an attempt to provide better versioning in ML workflows. Shoot me an email if you are interested.

This year, I'm rejoining [X Academy](https://www.techx.academy/) to kickstart a technical mentorship program for high schoolers to advance their field studies. If you are or know someone who might be interested in becoming a mentor, please email me.

I will be at Uber as a software engineering intern in the US summer 2021.
