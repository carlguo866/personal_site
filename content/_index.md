I am a Computer Science & Math undergrad at MIT. In general, I'm passionate about making AI and computing systems safe and efficient so they can benefit humanity at large. Specifically, I am interested in topics of mechanistic interpretability, program synthesis, and performance engineering.

## Experiences


I now try to understand the science of neural networks and interpret them in [Prof. Max Tegmark's lab](https://tegmark.org/). I have worked on measuring the algorithmic progress of language models and its role in AI scaling with [Epoch AI](https://epochai.org/) and [MIT FutureTech](https://futuretech.mit.edu/). Before that, I have researched neural compilation and SQL query compiler optimization in the [Supertech Group](https://supertech.mit.edu/).

## Misc

Before coming to the US for high school, I spent most of my life in Jinan, China, where I'm happy to call home.

In Winter 2023, I competed in MIT [Battlecode](https://battlecode.org/) and won 2nd place (read more [here](/portfolio/proj-battlecode)). I used to compete in college-level Mock Trial, for which I coded a [website](https://tabeasy.org/) for automatic tournament tabulation.

In my free time, I like to make coffee, listen to music on records, and run.
