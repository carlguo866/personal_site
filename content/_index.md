I am an undergrad at MIT studying Computer Science. I'm passionate about making AI and computing systems safe and efficient so they can benefit humanity at large; specifically, I am interested in interpretability and performance engineering.

<!-- Specifically, I wear two hats: the **"science"** hat where I explore model internals through mechanistic interpretability, and the **"engineering"** hat where I make GPUs go brrrrr. -->

## Experiences
I currently work on understanding LM's [internal world models](https://lingo.csail.mit.edu/blog/world_models/) in [Prof. Jacob Andreas's group](https://lingo.csail.mit.edu/), and have previously worked on training dynamics with [Prof. Max Tegmark](https://tegmark.org/).

I've also thought a lot about performance engineering as a TA for 6.106 (6.172) Software Performance Engineering and as an intern at [Together AI](https://together.ai/) and [WeRide.ai](https://www.weride.ai/). See a list of my publications [here](/publications). 

## News
- **March 4, 2025** Paper ["(How) Do Language Models Track State?"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02854) is on arXiv!
- **September 25, 2024**: Paper ["Algorithmic Progress in Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05812) is accepted as a poster at NeurIPS 2024!
- **June 24, 2024**: My paper ["Survival of the Fittest Representation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17420) is accepted to the ["Mechanistic Interpretability Workshop at ICML"](https://icml2024mi.pages.dev/)!
<!-- - **June 3, 2024**: I start as a MLSys Software Engineering Intern at [WeRide](https://www.weride.ai/) this summer! -->

## Misc

I went to [St. Mark's School](https://www.stmarksschool.org/) in Southborough, MA. Before coming to the US for high school, I spent most of my life in Jinan, China, where I'm happy to call home.

In Winter 2023, I competed in MIT [Battlecode](https://battlecode.org/) and won 2nd place (read more [here](/portfolio/proj-battlecode)). I used to compete in college-level Mock Trial, for which I coded a [website](https://tabeasy.org/) for automatic tournament tabulation.

In my free time, I do stand-up comedy, cook, and make coffee.
