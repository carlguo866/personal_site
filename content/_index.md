I am a Computer Science undergrad (6-3) at [MIT EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/). I'm passionate about making AI and computing systems reliable, safe, and efficient so they can benefit the humanity at large.

## Currently

This summer, I'm currently working in the MIT CSAIL [FutureTech Group](https://futuretech.mit.edu/) on a collaborative project with [Epoch AI](https://epochai.org/) on measuring algorithmic progress in language models over time. I also research how to optimizing SQL query compilers with MLIR in MIT CSAIL's [Supertech Group](https://supertech.mit.edu/).

I am working with [Rashmi K. Vinayak](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rvinayak/) and [Jack Kosaian](https://jackkosaian.github.io/) in [TheSys research group](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rvinayak/#group) as part of the [Parallel Data Lab](https://www.pdl.cmu.edu/index.shtml) on efficient fault tolerance strategy for embedding tables in distributed deep learning training. We tailor it to work specifically well in modern industrial recommender systems.

My journey with MLSys started from my work at ByteDance. I contributed to the graph embedding models and infrastructure in Douyin and TikTok, now serving 600M+ global users. It did not stop there. This year at Uber, I owned, designed, developed, and launched the Recommended Dishes carousel on the Uber Eats home feed, satisfying the cravings of 90M+ eaters around the world.

As some side fun, I'm incubating an open-source project [Alpaca-Hub](https://alpaca-hub.github.io/) as an attempt to provide better versioning in ML workflows. Another project that concerns distributed DL training in Golang (temporarily named Groot) is in our pipeline too. Shoot me an email if you are interested.

I will be continuing my education at CMU as a fifth-year master in machine learning. At the meantime, I am seeking summer 2022 internships and/or full-time opportunities beyond. -->

## Misc

Before coming to the US for high school, I spent most of my life in Jinan, China, where I'm happy to call home.

In Winter 2023, I competed in MIT [Battlecode](https://battlecode.org/) and won 2nd place. Find a blog about my experience [here](/pdfs/battlecode_report.pdf). I used to compete in college-level Mock Trial, for which I coded a [website](https://tabeasy.org/) for automatic tournament tabulation.

In my free time, I like to make coffee, listen to music on records, and run.
