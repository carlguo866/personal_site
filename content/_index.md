I am an undergrad at MIT studying Computer Science. I'm passionate about making AI and computing systems safe and efficient so they can benefit humanity at large. 

Specifically, I wear two hats: the **"science"** hat where I explore model internals through mechanistic interpretability, and the **"engineering"** hat where I make GPUs go brrrrr.

## Experiences
I now try to understand the science of neural networks and interpret them in [Max Tegmark's group](https://tegmark.org/). I have worked on compiler code generation using LLM with [William Moses](https://wsmoses.com/) and neural scaling law at [Epoch AI](https://epochai.org/). See a list of my publications [here](/publications). 

## News
- **June 24, 2024**: My paper ["Survival of the Fittest Representation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17420) is accepted to the ["Mechanistic Interpretability Workshop at ICML"](https://icml2024mi.pages.dev/)!
- **June 3, 2024**: I start as a MLSys Software Engineering Intern at [WeRide](https://www.weride.ai/) this summer!
- **May 20, 2024**: I'll be a Undergrad TA for **6.106 (6.172) Software Performance Engineering** in Fall 2024.

## Misc

Before coming to the US for high school, I spent most of my life in Jinan, China, where I'm happy to call home.

In Winter 2023, I competed in MIT [Battlecode](https://battlecode.org/) and won 2nd place (read more [here](/portfolio/proj-battlecode)). I used to compete in college-level Mock Trial, for which I coded a [website](https://tabeasy.org/) for automatic tournament tabulation.

In my free time, I like to make coffee, listen to music on records, and run.
