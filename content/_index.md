I am a Computer Science undergrad (6-3) at [MIT EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/). I'm passionate about making AI and computing systems reliable, safe, and efficient so they can benefit humanity at large.

## Currently

This summer, I'm currently working in MIT CSAIL's [FutureTech Group](https://futuretech.mit.edu/) on a collaborative project with [Epoch AI](https://epochai.org/) on measuring AI algorithmic progress. I also research how to optimizing SQL query compilers in MIT CSAIL's [Supertech Group](https://supertech.mit.edu/).

At school, I help run events for [MIT AI Alignment](https://www.mitalignment.org/), raising awareness for potential risks of increasingly capable AIs and supporting peers that want to do more research in this area.

## Misc

Before coming to the US for high school, I spent most of my life in Jinan, China, where I'm happy to call home.

In Winter 2023, I competed in MIT [Battlecode](https://battlecode.org/) and won 2nd place (read more [here](/portfolio/proj-battlecode)). I used to compete in college-level Mock Trial, for which I coded a [website](https://tabeasy.org/) for automatic tournament tabulation.

In my free time, I like to make coffee, listen to music on records, and run.
