I am a Computer Science undergrad (6-3) at [MIT EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/). I'm interested in making AI and computing systems reliable, safe, and efficient, so they can benefit the humanity at large.

<!--
I'm passionate about AI safety. on exploring the nature of machine learning and scaling it to build large systems that generate exponentially more impact. These include but are not limited to recommender systems, DL frameworks and infrastructures, MLOps systems, and federated learning. -->

<!-- ### Currently

I am working with [Rashmi K. Vinayak](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rvinayak/) and [Jack Kosaian](https://jackkosaian.github.io/) in [TheSys research group](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rvinayak/#group) as part of the [Parallel Data Lab](https://www.pdl.cmu.edu/index.shtml) on efficient fault tolerance strategy for embedding tables in distributed deep learning training. We tailor it to work specifically well in modern industrial recommender systems.

My journey with MLSys started from my work at ByteDance. I contributed to the graph embedding models and infrastructure in Douyin and TikTok, now serving 600M+ global users. It did not stop there. This year at Uber, I owned, designed, developed, and launched the Recommended Dishes carousel on the Uber Eats home feed, satisfying the cravings of 90M+ eaters around the world.

As some side fun, I'm incubating an open-source project [Alpaca-Hub](https://alpaca-hub.github.io/) as an attempt to provide better versioning in ML workflows. Another project that concerns distributed DL training in Golang (temporarily named Groot) is in our pipeline too. Shoot me an email if you are interested.

I will be continuing my education at CMU as a fifth-year master in machine learning. At the meantime, I am seeking summer 2022 internships and/or full-time opportunities beyond. -->
