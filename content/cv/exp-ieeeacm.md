I'm on the executive board for the [MIT Chapter](https://ieeeacm.mit.edu/) of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) & the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).

I host community-building events for EECS undergrad students, such as study breaks, major-exploration days, and faculty-study dinners, and maintain its website.

Here are some pictures:
