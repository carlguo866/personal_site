In Winter 2023, I competed in MIT [Battlecode](https://battlecode.org/) and won 2nd place (and $3000 prize money).

I had a great time competing with Yuxuan Chen, Ray Wang, and Temo Toloraia, under the team name `Gone Fishin'`, which is also my high school robotics team's name (not really creative I know :D).
