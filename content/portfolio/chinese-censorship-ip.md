In this independent research project, [Jeffrey Shen](http://jeffreyshen.com/) and I created [CensorScout](https://github.com/DPCLab/CensorScout-Front) and the [Weibo Censorship Dashboard](http://dpclab.org/china/dashboard/), two pilot applications that make several steps toward increased transparency into censorship on Weibo and provide valuable---albeit limited---information regarding the state of Chinese Internet censorship.

- Published paper for open access on [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3266193), made daily top-tens in several sections and top 10% of authors by downloads in the year following.
- Completed as part of [Digital Propaganda & Censorship](https://dpclab.org/), an Independent Project at Phillips Academy under the mentorship of [John Palfrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palfrey), Michael Barker, and Malgorzata Stergios.
