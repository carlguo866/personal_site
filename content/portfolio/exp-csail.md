I'm affiliated with the Supertech Group, led by Charles Leiserson, and FutureTech Group, led by Neil Thompson.

### Supertech Group

- I had the fortune to research in the Supertech Group when I was still a high school student as a part of the [MIT PRIMES](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/index.php) program. I worked with [Billy Moses](https://wsmoses.com/academic/) on applying Transformer deep learning models to analyze low-level languages like LLVM-IR. The resulting [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9926313) was published at IEEE HPEC '22.
- I now work on SQL query optimization with MLIR with Billy Moses.

### FutureTech Group

- I am working with [Tamay Besiroglu](https://tamaybesiroglu.com/) on measuring AI algorithmic progress.
