[Tabeasy](https://tabeasy.org/) is an open-sourced, free, mock trial tabulation site used by 20+ touranments and 10k+ people.

### Motivation

When I was competing in mock trial and then helping with running some tournaments, I found that most tournaments tabulate by hand, which is time-consuming, tedious, and prone to error. In the Summer of 2022, I coded this website to run the tabroom for Peer Potential Mock Trial, the biggest high school Mock Trial tournament in China. It was later adopted to run many other tournaments, including [International Mock Trial](https://www.internationalmocktrial.com/).

Besides my technical service to the Mock Trial community, I have coached a team that were 2-times national high school Mock Trial champions in China.

### Technical Details

Tabeasy enables automatic pairing generation, ballot submission and collection, award calculation, and a competitor portal for submitting captain's form to judges.

The project was built with Django, PostgreSQL, React, Bootstrap, and Alibaba Cloud.

My code is open-soured on [GitHub](https://github.com/carlguo866/tabeasy).
