I was a member of the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com)'s Spring 1 2020 batch; like all Recursers, I never graduated.

The Recurse Center---colloquially known as RC---is a self-directed academic retreat centered around programming (but certainly not limited to it). Everyone I met at RC was smart, nice, and thoughtful; I believe RC is one of the best communities in the world. It's completely free to attend, so if you're interested, [please apply](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=e62336f0f378bcf03a96d441d015db88).

While I was at RC, I built [Shynet](https://github.com/milesmcc/shynet), [a17t](https://github.com/milesmcc/a17t), and dozens of other smaller projects. I studied lossless compression, digital signal processing, cryptography, and whatever else piqued my interest on a given day.
