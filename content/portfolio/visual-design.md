Design is vague. I know. In this context, I'm referring to both _system design_ and _graphic design_.

When I design anything, my top priorities are usability, accessibility, and beauty. With these principles in mind, I built [a17t](https://github.com/milesmcc/a17t), my CSS library, and designed [several](https://whoaremyrepresentatives.org) [other](https://privacyspy.org) [websites](https://whyprivacymatters.org) (including the one you're on right now). I also do my best to apply these principles to software design and writing, but that's harder to showcase.

(If you're curious to see the evolution of this website, here are its incarnations: [2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20180126221250/http://rmrm.io/), and [2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127161558/https://rmrm.io/))

P.S.: In my (limited) experience, the principles I mentioned above almost always work together. A design with great usability will probably be accessible and beautiful, and vice versa. (That's not to say that special effort isn't sometimes required in some categories, especially accessibility.) As a bonus, I've found that the best design is often the simplest --- so I try to avoid complexity wherever I can.
