I went to [Beijing National Day School](http://www.bndsedu.com/) (Chinese: 北京十一学校, and sorry for the our sloppy website) for high school.

Different from what I focus in college (CS), in high school I primarily focused my area of study on mathematical modeling (with Haonan Zhu) and economics (with [Robert Rush](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-rush-81331128/)).

Just for fun: here's an economics paper I co-authored with my friend Michael, ["A Developed, Caring, and Sustainable Economy"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KGJXqNx6R8cJU9wHr1llnqBjKkzssuXR/view), in which we detailed our ideal model of economy (which we knew was unlikely to be realized any time soon).
