In the summer of 2018, I worked on the engineering and research teams of [First Look Media](https://firstlook.media), the parent company of [_The Intercept_](https://theintercept.com), primarily on authoring an IETF Internet Draft.

- Worked to create an IETF Internet standard (currently a proposed standard) for OpenPGP cryptographic keylist subscriptions, as implemented by Micah Lee's [GPGSync](https://github.com/firstlookmedia/gpgsync). The draft is available [here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mccain-keylist/). (I am the primary/first author.)
- Wrote an [engineering blog post](https://tech.firstlook.media/keylist-rfc-explainer) about the IETF project.
- Worked with the research team to perform data analysis on several unreleased datasets.
- Designed Presslist, a crowdsourced internal system to manage and track government contacts.
