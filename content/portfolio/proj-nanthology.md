I was the editor-in-chief for NAnthology, the biggest publishing platform for Chinese international students in American high schools on WeChat Official Account.

The platform had 121 writters over my three years. We have published 379 articles, had 12k+ subscribers, with average article views between 1000-4000+.

I have written about my [college application experience](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/h6QawuuYMZH6nOGwjc3hIA) and [graduating](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/kAd1lI8tT1UPdUe1a0uq7g), among other things.

I'm still decently involved with running the platform and advise the new editors.
