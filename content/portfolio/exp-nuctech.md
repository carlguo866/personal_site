**Baggage Re-Identiﬁcation for Smart Security Inspection**:

* Updated existing model from veriﬁcation scheme (Siamese nets) to the latest embedding scheme after implementing 5 models in PyTorch and evaluating performance on baggage datasets with hyperparam search.

* Achieved 0.76 accuracy of CMC rank-1 on image retrieval from a 500-baggage gallery, improving baseline by 80.9% in accuracy and about 10x in speed.

**Framework Development**:

* Migrated research framework from C/Caﬀe to Python/PyTorch and developed additional features including activation visualization, checkpointing, and metrics platform integration. -->
