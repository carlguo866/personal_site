### PACTF

I ran [PACTF](https://pactf.com), a global cybersecurity competition with over 1,000 teams and \$20,000 in prizes, in 2017 and 2018.

- After being a participant in PACTF 2016, in 2017 I became the project lead (with [Alex Reichenbach](https://github.com/Reichenbachian)).
- Managed sponsors, problem sets, advertising, and digital infrastructure (effectively the entire competition, though I couldn't have done it without help from the project mentors and the rest of the [team](https://2017.pactf.com/about/)).
- Sponsors include Amazon, J.P. Morgan, DigitalOcean, ProtonMail, Cloudflare, Carnegie Mellon University CyLab (Security and Privacy Institute), Carnegie Mellon University Information Networking Institute, and Phillips Academy Andover.

### Teaching

I have taught several summer computer science courses. It's always a lot of fun; often, we use Minecraft as a sandbox for our code. Sometimes, we're able to cover the entire AP CS curriculum in less than three months!

### Torch

I worked at [Torch](https://www.torch1.com/), an NYC-based tech and politics startup, in the summer of 2017. Torch provides social intelligence for nonprofits and philanthropic organizations.

- Led the development of Torch's "scraping" technology at the time ([OpenParser](https://github.com/torch1/openparser)).
- Rebranded a major element of the Torch platform ("watchlists"), making the platform more immediately useful and accessible to non-technical users.
- Provided the company with gigabytes of invaluable civic information from various APIs.
- Position obtained after they reached out to me about [WhyAreMyRepresentatives.org](https://whoaremyrepresentatives.org/).
