Most of the software I write is open source, and some people have found this software helpful: collectively, my [repositories](https://github.com/milesmcc) have over 1,000 "stars" on GitHub. In maintaining and contributing to these projects, I've learned about effective community building, communication, advertising, and documentation.

Here are some of the open source projects I maintain:

* [Shynet](https://github.com/milesmcc/shynet)
* [a17t](https://github.com/milesmcc/a17t)
* [PrivacySpy](https://github.com/Politiwatch/PrivacySpy) (with Igor Barakaiev)
* [WhyPrivacyMatters](https://github.com/milesmcc/whyprivacymatters)
* [LibreNews](https://github.com/milesmcc/librenews-server)
* [IEQL](https://github.com/milesmcc/a17t)

I also make an effort to contribute to other open source projects as well. I've contributed code and/or documentation changes to [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [TensorForce](https://github.com/tensorforce/tensorforce), [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym/), [MonicaHQ](https://github.com/monicahq/monica), and several other projects.
