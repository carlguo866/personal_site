Since Fall 2022, I've been an undergraduate student at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) studying Computer Science (and maybe Political Science).

I declared to major in Computer Science and Engineering (Course 6-3) in Spring 2023. I'm also on the track to get a major/minor in Political Science (Course 17).

My current GPA is 5.0/5.0 if that matters.
