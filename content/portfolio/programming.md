I love computing; I enjoy building systems, as well as just programming for programming's sake. (The [Joy of Computing](https://joy.recurse.com)!)

I am experienced with Python, Rust, Java, and Haskell, as well as the typical assortment web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, React, Vue, Svelte, and Angular). I'm also comfortable using Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Linux, and other systems.

I have some experience with cryptography and the network stack.
