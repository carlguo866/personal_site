[Solved Chinese](https://tabeasy.org/) is a research-based vocab-memorizing web app for Chinese language learners that makes learning intuitive and easy with character-component breakdown and spaced-repetition.

I was one of the 5 founding members that grew to a team of 65 before we stopped working on it. It has been used by 10+ schools in their Chinese classes and has 100+ users.

### Technical Details

The project was built with Django REST, PostgreSQL, React, and Alibaba Cloud.

The code is open-soured on [GitHub](https://github.com/solved-chinese).
