I help organize events for [MIT AI Alignment (MAIA)](https://www.mitalignment.org/), a student group at MIT that tries to build a platform for people to upskill in machine learning and its safety so they can conduct original research.

- I'm a member of the joint Strategy Team between MAIA and [Harvard AI Safety Team (HAIST)](https://haist.ai/), where I think about building the field of AI safety in China and promoting collobarations.

- I help organize weekly [AGI Safety Foundamentals](https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/ai-alignment-curriculum) series for 80+ MIT students and speaker series of leading researchers, including Chris Olah and Neel Nanda. -->
