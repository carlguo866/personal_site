In this independent research project, [Jeffrey Shen](http://jeffreyshen.com/) and I used machine learning and statistics to better understand the Russian disinformation campaign in the 2016 election. We released three [blog posts](https://dpclab.org/russia/), launched a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/TrackTheTrolls), an [open API](https://dpclab.org/russia/machine-learning-troll-detection/), and deployed an [interactive machine learning model](https://dpclab.org/russia/troll-explorer/).

- Published paper for open access on [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3266193), made daily top-tens in several sections.
- Completed as part of [Digital Propaganda & Censorship](https://dpclab.org/), an Independent Project at Phillips Academy under the mentorship of [John Palfrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palfrey), Michael Barker, and Malgorzata Stergios.
