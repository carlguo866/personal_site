### A Note on Tags

On this site, I try to minimize the role of tags. They're helpful for RSS, but most web navigation is done via the top tabs.

There are two gotchas:

* Certain tag pages redirect to other pages. I set these up usually for tags that correspond to projects; for example, the "shynet" tab.

* Portfolio projects should _not_ be tagged as themselves; that is, the portfolio project "Shynet" should _not_ have the "Shynet" tag.
